    "The measurement plan for the Homepage experiment asks the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does receiving the homepage treatment increase editor activation?\n",
    "* Does receiving the homepage treatment increase editor retention?\n",
    "* Does having access to the homepage treatment increase the average number of edits in the first two weeks after registration?\n",
    "* Does having access to the homepage increase the proportion of constructive edits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional questions from T218703:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having a confirmed email address\n",
    "* Having created a user page (even if subsequently deleted)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I'd like to have a canonical dataset of users stored in the Data Lake such that it's easy to retrieve. This can then form the basis for gathering various datasets. One of the reasons for having a single source of truth is that we in this case have a complex set of criteria for selecting users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the first four questions, I'd like to have data on both edits in the article namespace and other namespaces. That will enable us to learn whether the intervention affects either of those separately. This is particularly relevant because the Homepage has elements that make the first edit easier (e.g. starting a user page or asking your mentor a question). Both of those are outside the article namespace.\n",

Because about 50% of these registrations are in the control group, it means that in the treatment group 5% in Czech, and 7.8% in Korean register on mobile and then later go on to visit the Homepage. That's definitely a large enough part of the treatment group that there is no point in trying to claim that mobile registrations don't carry over to the desktop site, it's clear that somewhere in the 5–10% range do, and it looks like it depends on the wiki. We could also speculate that these users are highly prolific ones, thereby making the control/treatment distinction difficult to make. So, we'll count *all registrations* from desktop deployment onwards as part of the experiment."

We then connect this dataset with `ServerSideAccountCreation` to get desktop/mobile data, filter out API creations, and verify autocreation status. Next, we use the MediaWiki table to get treatment/control assignment. Lastly, we use the `PrefUpdate` schema to filter out users who switched the Homepage option on/off."

In other words, we can learn to what extent users are activated/retained by editing articles, user (creating their user page), talk (asking their mentor or responding to communication), and \"other\" (e.g. Help Desk).\n",
