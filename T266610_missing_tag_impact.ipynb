    "# Impact of Missing Newcomer Task Edit Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "The phab task for this is [T266610](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T266610). Per the task and its parent task, starting on 2020-09-15 certain conditions led to the \"newcomer task\" tag not being added to an edit. A fix was deployed on 2020-10-28.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bug was triggered when the user visits the Homepage and clicks on the first card shown in the Newcomer Task queue. That card had an incorrect URL. If they changed their topics or difficulty settings, then the URL was correct and the \"newcomer task\" tag was applied to edits to the article. I tested on French Wikipedia, and going through the initialization process resulted in the correct URL being shown, so we can exclude those sessions too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to get a historic estimate of how often users edited a task under those conditions, and then use that to estimate the actual number of task edits based on the number of existing tagged edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the proposed approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify Homepage sessions that have an impression/task click of the task with position 0.\n",
    "2. Remove sessions where said impression/click occurred *after* changing topics or difficulty, or after the user initialized the Newcomer Tasks module. Note that if the user didn't make any changes to the topics or diffculty setting, the bug is still present. We're going to ignore that and assume that users who clicked to save topic/difficulty changes actually changed them, rather than add complexity to identify whether they changed anything.\n",
    "3. Identify the page ID of the recommended task.\n",
    "4. Use `event.mediawiki_revision_tags_change` table to identify edits to those pages within 7 days of the task impression/click.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll exclude known test users in the same way that we usually do. And we'll count tagged edits per week similarly as we do in the reporting notebook. Then, we'll calculate a proportion on a weekly basis and summarize it. While those exclusions mean that the edit counts won't match the previously reported numbers, we want to use the best approaches in order to estimate the impact this bug had on actual users. That means removing test users makes absolute sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll focus on the Guidance era because our instrumentation changed when Guidance was introduced. This simplifies the queries. It also means that we're limited to a three month period of data, from 2020-06-15 to 2020-09-15."

    "Doing things this way have some important implications and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using client-side EventLogging data from the HomepageModule schema to identify user sessions where an impression or click took place. We know from before (e.g. [T243632#5898720](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T243632#5898720)) that ad blockers or other things might affect this data. Based on that previous analysis, we're expecting to see about 10% of users block EL completely, and another 10â€“15% block it some of the time. We've also seen evidence that blocking is more likely for highly prolific users, because on a per-session basis the block percentage is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this notebook makes the assumption that the impact of ad/JavaScript blocking is relatively consistent so that calculating a proportion of edits makes sense. Secondly, we're assuming the proportion behaves in such a way that we can calculate either a mean and standard deviation or a median and an interquartile range from the proportion and get meaningful results."
